# Stock-Market-Analysis

In this notebook we will be looking at TSX(Toronto Stock Exchage) data to help me manage my protfolio and do analysis to pick stocks for long term investment and increase profit on trading(swing trade). Basically this project will help me to automate my day to day manual analysis on stock market and help me not to miss any opportunity in the market to maximize my profit. 

*What Tecnology i will use in this projcet.*<br>
`Python`<br>


### We will try to do following
1. Market overview
    * Top 10 stocks to watchout for
    * Top winner and losers
2. Manage my own portfolio?
    * Keep track of stock buy and sell.
    * Current profit and loss(in percentage and CAD).
    * Recommend how much to invest every week and which stock to pick.
    * Check diversification of the stock and recommend stock or sector.
    * Show my portfolio in visualization.
3. Which stock to pick for long term? 
    * base on fundamental analysis of stock (PE and other ratios)
    * based on the yield and growth 
    * based on recent price action(Catch the dip)
4. Which stock to pick of swing trade
    * based on price action 
      * % change
      * 52 weeks high and low (compare to current)

### How I think i will do it (I am sure will change with time)
1. Data extraction
   * The first step is obviously to collect data. I think the best way to do so is by an API. If not then my second option is do with web scrapping.
2. Data Cleaning  
   * selecting only the needed data
3. Data Quering 
   * pick and recommend stocks
4. Data Visualization
